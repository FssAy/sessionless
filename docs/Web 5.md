[Web5](https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-js) is an interesting project maintained by a branch of Square called TBD. It gives a good opportunity to talk about some concepts in the crypto world. To keep this brief I'll just talk about three, blockchain, decentralization, and crypto. To some these three are intertwined, but in reality they're separate elements of which cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum combine into one. Different combinations of these three provide different possibilities.
