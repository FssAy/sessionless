# Sessionless

*Sessionless* is an attempt to make authentication handling easier for developers and users, while also enabling interesting behavior not possible with traditional sessions.

With Sessionless, and any subesequent open source projects I start, I'm trying to make them accessible to all parts of the tech industry. 
Right now that means focusing on dev, UX, and product, but qa, analytics, customer success, etc. are all welcome.
Trust me, there's plenty of work to go around.

To this end, I'm going to try my best to provide domain-specific documentation as an entry point. 
This is very much a wip, and, as far as I know, not something that there's an established pattern for so all feedback welcome.

| Dev          | UX          | Product     |
